## Hey there 👋

Hello, I'm Haeje Park. I have been developing in Java since 2020 and currently work as a backend developer at a company that uses the MSA-based Spring Boot framework. In addition, I have a personal interest in app development and have even released an app called Awesome Talk, built on React Native.

My current tech stack of interest includes Flutter, Elixir (especially), and Python, and I am also planning to learn Kubernetes for infrastructure operations. Overall, I am a person who enjoys working with technology and always strives to make work fun and enjoyable. Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction!

Awesome Talk is an anonymous chat app based on user location that I developed using React Native and the Expo framework for both Android and iOS. As someone who is passionate about chat apps and their content, I decided to dive into React Native to create something of my own. However, as a beginner, I faced some challenges in bringing the app to a level of polish that I was happy with. Additionally, our image viewer with Zoom functionality still has some pesky bugs that continue to give me a headache. (Looks like we need to hire a UI designer to help make Awesome Talk not just awesome, but also easy on the eyes!)
