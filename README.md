## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Haeje Park. I have been developing in Java since 2020 and currently work as a backend developer at a company that uses the MSA-based Spring Boot framework. In addition, I have a personal interest in app development and have even released an app called Awesome Talk, built on React Native.

My current tech stack of interest includes Flutter, Elixir (especially), and Python, and I am also planning to learn Kubernetes for infrastructure operations. Overall, I am a person who enjoys working with technology and always strives to make work fun and enjoyable. Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction!
